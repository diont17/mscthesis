  abstract = {A new portable NMR sensor with a novel one-sided access magnet design, termed NMR-MOLE (MObile Lateral Explorer), has been characterised in terms of sensitivity and depth penetration. The magnet has been designed to be portable and create a volume with a relatively homogeneous magnetic field, 15,000 ppm over a region from 4 to 16 mm away from the probe, with maximum sensitivity at a depth of 10 mm. The proton NMR frequency is 3.3 MHz. We have demonstrated that with this approach a highly sensitive, portable, unilateral NMR sensor can be built. Such a design is especially suited for the characterisation of liquids in situations where unilateral or portable access is required.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic relaxation rates are measured for whole blood, blood plasma, whole blood clots, and plasma clots in vitro. Relaxation rates are linear in the hematocrit and transverse relaxation rates are significantly greater than longitudinal relaxation rates. Longitudinal relaxation rates measured from 0.01 to 42 MHz for proton Larmor frequencies are found to decline monotonically with increasing magnetic field strength; however, the dispersion curves do not follow a simple Lorentzian behavior, which is anticipated in a suspension of particles in a solution of proteins having a distribution of molecular weights. The transverse relaxation rate is a function of the acquisition parameters, in particular, the choice of TE in either Hahn echo experiments or in echo-train experiments. The origin of this dependence of T2 on TE or the interpulse spacing in an echo train is identified with the exchange of water from inside the red blood cell to the outside and is only an important relaxation mechanism in the case where the blood cell membrane is intact and the cell contains deoxygenated hemoglobin. The dependence of the apparent transverse relaxation rate on the interpulse spacing in a Meiboom-Gill-Carr-Purcell pulse sequence provides the estimate that the mean residence time of water inside the blood cell is about 10 ms. These data provide a sound basis for understanding the dependence of magnetic images on magnetic field strength and the choices of the image acquisition parameters, TE and TR.},

  abstract = {The oxygen extraction fraction of the brain reports on the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption and can be used to assess deviations in physiological homeostasis. This is relevant clinically as well as for calibrating blood oxygen level\textendash{}dependent functional MRI responses. Oxygen extraction fraction is reflected in the arteriovenous difference in oxygen saturation fraction (Yv - Ya), which can be determined from venous T2 values when arterial oxygenation is known. A pulse sequence is presented that allows rapid measurement ($<$1 min) of blood T2s in the internal jugular vein. The technique combines slice-saturation and blood inflow to attain high signal-to-noise ratio in blood and minimal contamination from tissue. The sequence is sensitized to T2 using a nonselective Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 preparation directly after slice saturation. Fast scanning (pulse repetition time of about 2 sec) is possible by using a nonselective saturation directly after acquisition to rapidly achieve steady-state longitudinal magnetization. The venous T2 (for 10 msec Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill interecho time) for normal volunteers was 62.4 $\pm$ 6.1 msec (n = 20). A calibration curve relating T2 to blood oxygenation was established using a blood perfusion phantom. Using this calibration, a whole-brain oxygen extraction fraction of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.04 was determined (n = 20), in excellent agreement with literature values.

Here, a modified Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) multiecho experiment was used to increase the efficiency and precision of this approach and to test the applicability of the two-compartment exchange model for spin-echo BOLD effects in pure venous blood. Relaxation measurements on bovine blood as a function of CPMG interecho spacing, oxygen saturation, and hematocrit provided the baseline relaxation and susceptibility shift parameters necessary to directly relate OER to T2 of venous blood in vivo. Using an interecho spacing of 25 ms, the results on visual activation studies in eight volunteers showed T2(CPMG) values increasing from 128 $\pm$ 9 ms to 174 $\pm$ 18 ms upon activation, corresponding to local OER values of 0.38 $\pm$ 0.04 and 0.18 $\pm$ 0.05 during baseline activity and visual stimulation, respectively.

  abstract = {A precise understanding of human blood spin\textendash{}spin relaxation is of major importance for numerous applications, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is increasingly performed at 3 Tesla. It is well known that T2 measured from partially deoxygenated blood depends on the Carr\textendash{}Purcell Meiboom\textendash{}Gill (CPMG) refocusing interval ($\tau$180) and on blood oxygenation (Y), yet debate remains over the quantification of this phenomenon, primarily with respect to the accuracy of its characterization by the diffusion and fast two-site exchange models. In this study, a detailed characterization of the deoxygenation-induced T2 reduction in human whole blood, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the role of $\tau$180, were performed at 3 T. The diffusion model was found to better fit the observed T2 behavior as compared with the exchange model. The estimated diffusion-model parameters suggest the T2 decay enhancement at 3 T is due to a linear increase in the magnitude of deoxygenation-induced field inhomogeneities with field strength. These findings also confirm the potential of $\tau$180 manipulation in measuring changes in venous blood volume. Magn Reson Med 61:249\textendash{}254, 2009. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Blood 1H2O R1 values for different conditions could be readily fitted using a two-compartment (erythrocyte and plasma) model, which are described by a monoexponential longitudinal relaxation rate constant dependence. It was found that T1 = 2171 $\pm$ 39 ms for Y = 1 (arterial blood) and 2010 $\pm$ 41 ms for Y = 0.6 (venous blood), for a typical Hct of 0.42.

Natural aggregation of red cells into rouleaux appeared to cause most of the variation among results from NMR experiments. The remainder of the discrepancy was attributed to the use of inappropriate mathematical approximations of the two-site exchange equations, differences in blood storage time, and failure to adjust NMR calculations for the nonwater protons. Differences in hematocrit, frequency-magnetic field strength, or NMR pulse technique played no apparent role in the disparity among NMR reports. When these confounding factors were removed, diffusion results obtained by NMR or by influx or bulk diffusion of radioactive tracer agreed within a relatively narrow range of values. These techniques place the mean lifetime of water inside fresh normal human erythrocytes at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) between the extremes of 9.8 and 14 ms, where the uncorrected range was previously 9.8-21.7 ms. This new range of water exchange times corresponds to a range of diffusional permeability between 3.3 and 4.7 x 10(-3) cm/s.},

A small value of $\Delta$B tends to rule out transmembrane exchange as an important contributor to relaxation in MRI of blood and hematomas. However, the broadening of the resonances with deoxygenation, by 0.3-0.4 ppm, indicates that both intra- and extracellular gradients are of comparable and sufficient magnitude to produce the T2-weighted hypointensity seen in clinical magnetic resonance images of hematomas at high fields. \textcopyright{} 1989 Academic Press, Inc.},

The theory applies when the inhomogeneities are weak in magnitude and the nuclear spins diffuse a significant distance in comparison with a length scale characterizing the inhomogeneities. It is shown that the relaxation rate is determined by a temporal correlation function and depends quadratically on the magnitude of the inhomogeneities. For the case of unrestricted diffusion, a simple algebraic approximation for the temporal correlation function is derived. The theory is illustrated by applying it to a model of randomly distributed magnetized spheres. The theory is also used to fit experimental data for the dependence of the relaxation rate on the interecho time for a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence.

  abstract = {Human whole-blood relaxometry experiments were performed to allow the prediction of blood signal changes with blood oxygen saturation (Y) and refocusing interval ($\tau$180). Such predictions are particularly relevant for spin-echo (SE) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) experiments and a recently proposed noninvasive fMRI method for measuring cerebral blood volume (CBV). Ensemble fitting of the entire set of T2 estimates, obtained over an extensive range of Y and $\tau$180 values, was performed with the use of both a fast chemical exchange model and a model of diffusion in weak magnetic field inhomogeneities. The diffusion modeling resulted in a large reduction in the residual sum-of-squares compared to the fast exchange modeling.

  abstract = {The quantitative evaluation of brain hemodynamics and metabolism, particularly the relationship between brain function and oxygen utilization, is important for the understanding of normal human brain operation, as well as the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. It can also be of great importance for the evaluation of hypoxia within tumors of the brain and other organs. A fundamental discovery by Ogawa and coworkers of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast opened up the possibility to use this effect to study brain hemodynamic and metabolic properties by means of MRI measurements. Such measurements require the development of theoretical models connecting the MRI signal to brain structure and function, and the design of experimental techniques allowing MR measurements to be made of the salient features of theoretical models. In this review, we discuss several such theoretical models and experimental methods for the quantification of brain hemodynamic and metabolic properties. The review's main focus is on methods for the evaluation of the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) based on the measurement of the blood oxygenation level. A combination of the measurement of OEF and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows an evaluation to be made of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). We first consider in detail the magnetic properties of blood \textendash{} magnetic susceptibility, MR relaxation and theoretical models of the intravascular contribution to the MR signal under different experimental conditions. We then describe a `through-space' effect \textendash{} the influence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields, created in the extravascular space by intravascular deoxygenated blood, on the formation of the MR signal. Further, we describe several experimental techniques taking advantage of these theoretical models. Some of these techniques \textendash{} MR susceptometry and T2-based quantification of OEF \textendash{} utilize the intravascular MR signal. Another technique \textendash{} quantitative BOLD \textendash{} evaluates OEF by making use of through-space effects. In this review, we target both scientists just entering the MR field and more experienced MR researchers interested in the application of advanced BOLD-based techniques to the study of the brain in health and disease.

Knowing the water transverse (R2) relaxation rates from these different blood compartments is a prerequisite for quantifying the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect. Here, we report the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) based transverse (R2CPMG) relaxation rates of water in bovine blood samples circulated in a perfusion system at physiological temperature in order to mimic blood perfusion in humans. R2CPMG values of blood plasma, lysed packed erythrocytes, lysed plasma/erythrocyte mixtures, and whole blood at 3 T, 7 T, 9.4 T, 11.7 T and 16.4 T were measured as a function of hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration, oxygenation, and CPMG inter-echo spacing ($\tau$cp). R2CPMG in lysed cells showed a small $\tau$cp dependence, attributed to the water exchange rate between free and hemoglobin-bound water to be much faster than $\tau$cp. This was contrary to the tangential dependence in whole blood, where a much slower exchange between cells and blood plasma applies. Whole blood data were fitted as a function of $\tau$cp using a general tangential correlation time model applicable for exchange as well as diffusion contributions to R2CPMG, and the intercept R20blood at infinitely short $\tau$cp was determined. The R20blood values at different hematocrit and the R2CPMG values of lysed erythrocyte/plasma mixtures at different hemoglobin concentration were used to determine the relaxivity of hemoglobin inside the erythrocyte (r2Hb) and albumin (r2Alb) in plasma. The r2Hb values obtained from lysed erythrocytes and whole blood were comparable at full oxygenation. However, while r2Hb determined from lysed cells showed a linear dependence on oxygenation, this dependence became quadratic in whole blood. This possibly suggests an additional relaxation effect inside intact cells, perhaps due to hemoglobin proximity to the erythrocyte membrane. However, we cannot exclude that this is a consequence of the simple tangential model used to remove relaxation contributions from exchange and diffusion. The extensive data set presented should be useful for future theory development for the transverse relaxation of blood.},

The results illustrate how diffusion-sensitizing gradients affect the T2 spectra of blood and how relaxation weighting changes the curvature of the diffusion curves, thereby demonstrating the close coupling between diffusion and T2 relaxation. A three-pool model, consisting of RBCs, plasma, and macromolecular protons, was used to model the data from the diffusion-relaxation hybrid experiments. The model was found to describe all the characteristic features of the experimental data well and was used to evaluate the approximations involved in the conventional analysis methods and elucidate the nature of the relaxing and diffusing components.

  abstract = {Purpose

We propose an analytical method for calculating blood hematocrit (Hct) and oxygen saturation (sO2) from measurements of its T1 and T2 relaxation times.

Theory

Through algebraic substitution, established two-compartment relationships describing
R1=T1-1 and
R2=T2-1 as a function of hematocrit and oxygen saturation were rearranged to solve for Hct and sO2 in terms of R1 and R2. Resulting solutions for Hct and sO2 are the roots of cubic polynomials.

Methods

Feasibility of the method was established by comparison of Hct and sO2 estimates obtained from relaxometry measurements (at 1.5 Tesla) in cord blood specimens to ground-truth values obtained by blood gas analysis. Monte Carlo simulations were also conducted to assess the effect of T1, T2 measurement uncertainty on precision of Hct and sO2 estimates.

Results

Good agreement was observed between estimated and ground-truth blood properties (bias\,=\,0.01; 95\% limits of agreement\,=\,$\pm$0.13 for Hct and sO2). Considering the combined effects of biological variability and random measurement noise, we estimate a typical uncertainty of $\pm$0.1 for Hct, sO2 estimates.

Conclusion

Results demonstrate accurate quantification of Hct and sO2 from T1 and T2. This method is applicable to noninvasive fetal vessel oximetry\textemdash{}an application where existing oximetry devices are unusable or require risky blood-sampling procedures.

The width of the resolved lines allowed an estimate of the maximum contribution that diffusion makes to T2 relaxation at 7 T. The dependence of the diffusion contribution on the square of the strength of the static magnetic field suggests that diffusion makes a small contribution to water proton T2 relaxation at 1.5 T compared to 7 T, and a negligible one at 0.5 T in early and intermediate hematomas containing deoxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin in intact red blood cells. At the lower field strengths, water proton T2 relaxation is apparently dominated by the rapid chemical exchange (mean lifetime $\tau$ = 10 msec) between the intra- and extracellular environments.},

  abstract = {Purpose

To characterize the MRI relaxation properties of human umbilical cord blood at 1.5 Tesla.

Methods

Relaxometry measurements were performed on cord blood specimens (N = 88, derived from six caesarean deliveries) spanning a broad range of hematocrits (Hct = 0.19\textendash{}0.76) and oxygen saturations (sO2 = 4\textendash{}100\%), to characterize the dependence of T1 and T2 on these blood properties. Adult blood data (N = 31 specimens, derived from two volunteers) were similarly studied to validate our experimental methods by comparison with existing literature. Using biophysical models previously developed for adult blood, new model parameters were estimated, which relate Hct and sO2 to the observed cord blood relaxation times.

Results

Fitted biophysical models explained more than 90\% of the variation in T1 and T2. In general, T2 relaxation times of cord blood were longer (by up to 35\%) than those of adult blood, whereas T1 relaxation times were slightly shorter (by up to 10\%).

Conclusions

The models and fitted parameters presented here can be used for calibration of future MRI investigations of fetal and neonatal blood physiology. This study is an important step in facilitating accurate, noninvasive assessments of fetal blood oxygen content, a valuable diagnostic parameter in the identification and treatment of fetal hypoxia.

  abstract = {Purpose

To determine the contribution of paramagnetic dissolved oxygen in blood plasma to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in hyperoxic calibrated BOLD studies.

Methods

Bovine blood plasma samples were prepared with partial pressures of oxygen (pO2) ranging from 110 to 600 mmHg. R1, R2, and R2* of the plasma with dissolved oxygen were measured using quantitative MRI sequences at 3 Tesla. Simulations were performed to predict the relative effects of dissolved oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin changes in hyperoxia calibrated BOLD.

Results

The relaxivities of dissolved oxygen in plasma were found to be r1, O2 =1.97 $\pm$ 0.09 \texttimes{}10-4 s-1mmHg-1, r2, O2 =2.3 $\pm$ 0.7 \texttimes{}10-4 s-1mmHg-1, and r2, O2* = 2.3 $\pm$ 0.7 \texttimes{}10-4 s-1mmHg-1. Simulations predict that neither the transverse nor longitudinal relaxation rates of dissolved oxygen contribute significantly to the BOLD signal during hyperoxia.

Conclusion

During hyperoxia, the increases in R2 and R2* of blood from dissolved oxygen in plasma are considerably less than the decreases in R2 and R2* from venous deoxyhemoglobin. R1 effects due to dissolved oxygen are also predicted to be negligible. As a result, dissolved oxygen in arteries should not contribute significantly to the hyperoxic calibrated BOLD signal.

Presently there is no one widely accepted method for measuring the plasma hemoglobin concentration. Nine currently used assays, classified as either direct optical or added chemical techniques, were evaluated for accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, interference effects, and ease of use by adding hemoglobin (1\textendash{}200 mg/dl) to saline, lipid, and bilirubin solutions and to normal cow plasma. Most of the assays displayed good linearity, accuracy, and reproducibility down to 1 mg/dl when interferents were absent. However, representative of the effects caused by interferents, the endogenous hemoglobin concentration of a typical cow plasma sample measured by the 9 techniques ranged from -2 to 39 mg/dl. Although used by fewer organizations, some of the direct optical spectrophotometric methods (e.g., the Cripps and Harboe baseline correction methods) are safer, easier, and more precise and accurate than the chemical addition methods used to measure plasma hemoglobin concentration from in vitro blood damage testing of medical devices.},

The application of this method at high spatial resolution is motivated by a desire to measure vascular flow in living plants and variations in molecular self-diffusion under the influence of velocity shear in narrow capillaries. The theory of dynamic NMR microscopy is presented and potential artifacts discussed, including the effect of slice selection gradients, PGSE gradient nonuniformity, and specific problems associated with the measurement of self-diffusion in the presence of velocity gradients. It is demonstrated that a double-echo PGSE pulse sequence can be used to restore coherent phase shifts associated with steady-state flow, and examples of self-diffusion maps and signed velocity maps from sequences of phase-encoded images obtained by projection reconstruction are given.

To better understand the intravascular contribution in quantitative terms, the spin-echo (SE) and GRE transverse relaxation rates, R2 and R\,2*, of isolated blood were measured as a function of oxygenation in a perfusion system. Over the normal oxygenation saturation range of blood between veins, capillaries, and arteries, the difference between these rates, R${'}$2 = R\,2* - R2, ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 Hz at 1.5 T and from 26 to 36 Hz at 4.7 T. The blood data were used to calculate the expected intravascular BOLD effects for physiological oxygenation changes that are typical during visual activation. This modeling showed that intravascular $\Delta$R\,2* is caused mainly by R2 relaxation changes, namely 85\% and 78\% at 1.5T and 4.7T, respectively. The simulations also show that at longer TEs ($>$70 ms), the intravascular contribution to the percentual BOLD change is smaller at high field than at low field, especially for GRE experiments. At shorter TE values, the opposite is the case. For pure parenchyma, the intravascular BOLD signal changes originate predominantly from venules for all TEs at low field and for short TEs at high field. At longer TEs at high field, the capillary contribution dominates. The possible influence of partial volume contributions with large vessels was also simulated, showing large (two- to threefold) increases in the total intravascular BOLD effect for both GRE and SE.

In a temperature controlled circulation system, these rates were measured for blood in vitro at 3T under conditions akin to the physiological state. Single spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GRE) sequences were used to determine R2 and R\,2*, respectively. Both rates varied quadratically with deoxygenation, and changes in R\,2* were found to be due predominantly to changes in R2. These data were used to estimate intravascular blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contributions during visual activation. Due to the large R\,2* in venous blood, intravascular SE BOLD signal changes were larger than GRE effects at echo times above 30 ms. When including extravascular effects to estimate the total BOLD effect, GRE BOLD dominated due to the large tissue volume fraction.

The book covers both time and frequency domain methodologies, as well as advances in scattering and diffraction methods, multidimensional exchange and correlation experiments and orientational correlation methods ideal for studying anisotropic environments. At the heart of these new methods resides the ubiquitous spin echo, a phenomenon whose discovery underpins nearly every major development in magnetic resonance methodology. Measuring molecular translational motion does not require high spectral resolution and so finds application in new NMR technologies concerned with 'outside the laboratory' applications, in geophysics and petroleum physics, in horticulture, in food technology, in security screening, and in environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H0. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

In this method the PGSE contrast gradient is stepped in a fourth dimension (q space) and so is inherently inefficient. Provided that one is prepared to sacrifice some of the additional information provided by the multiple PGSE gradient approach, it is possible to construct a velocity image alone by means of a single PGSE phase-encoding step. We illustrate applications of this method in which a signal from the stationary spins is nulled by the use of both gradient phase cycling and a final ``z-storage'' rf pulse. The limits to velocity resolution are around 10$\mu$m s-1 in free water but can be considerably smaller for molecules with a low self-diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate this method in a study of water capillary flow at 12 $\mu$m transverse pixel resolution, extending the velocity range by employing a four-quadrant analysis method. This method is also used to measure vascular transport in a living plant and find a flow rate of around 45$\mu$m s-1. \textcopyright{} 1992 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygenation can serve as a tool for better understanding fMRI signals and for clinical evaluation of brain oxygen homeostasis. In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 $\pm$ 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 $\pm$ 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 $\pm$ 1.1\%. On the other hand, caffeine ingestion resulted in a decrease in oxygenation by 7.0 $\pm$ 1.8\%. Contrast agent infusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg) reduced venous blood T2 by 11.2 ms. The results of this study show that TRUST MRI is a useful technique for quantitative assessment of blood oxygenation in the brain.

  abstract = {Purpose

To investigate the feasibility of estimating calibration constants (K and T2o) in vivo for converting whole-blood T2 to blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (HbO2) according to the Luz-Meiboom model,
1/T2=1/T2o+K(1-HbO2)2, where K and T2o are relaxivity and transverse relaxation time of fully saturated blood, respectively.

Methods

A range of HbO2 values was achieved in the superficial femoral vein with intermittent cuff occlusion in seven healthy adults (four males) to establish a calibration curve between blood T2 and HbO2 at 1.5T. HbO2 was derived via MR susceptometry, a technique previously validated, and the transverse relaxation time was quantified with an optimized T2-prepared balanced steady-state free precession pulse sequence. To evaluate the accuracy of the in vivo calibration method, T2 and HbO2 were quantified in the superior sagittal sinus in six additional subjects and compared with susceptometry.

Results

Two sets of gender-specific calibration constants were derived, one for each gender corresponding to hematocrits of 0.47\,$\pm$\,0.02 for males and 0.38\,$\pm$\,0.01 for females, yielding K/T2o\,=\,41\,Hz/260 ms and 26\,Hz/280 ms, respectively. The in vivo calibration returned physiologically plausible superior sagittal sinus SvO2 values (65\,$\pm$\,5\% HbO2), and there was no significant difference between the results from the two methods (average difference -0.3\% HbO2).

Conclusion

The results show feasibility of performing in vivo calibration for converting whole-blood T2 to HbO2. The proposed approach bypasses the involved and cumbersome processes associated with in vitro calibration.

Specifically, based on susceptibility measurements in the resting states, pial veins were found to have a mean oxygen saturation of Yrest = 0.544 $\pm$ 0.029 averaged over 14 vessels in 5 volunteers. During activation, susceptibility measurements revealed an oxygen saturation change of $\Delta$Ysusc = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.02. Independent evaluation from blood flow velocity measurements yielded a value of $\Delta$Yflow = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 for this change. These results validate the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) model in functional MRI (fMRI). Hum. Brain Mapping 5:341\textendash{}346, 1997. \textcopyright{} 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We present a noninvasive approach to measure oxygen saturation in vivo in the internal jugular vein using MR susceptometry by exploiting the characteristic susceptibility of deoxyhemoglobin, and demonstrate the feasibility of performing such measurements in a group of subjects. We assessed the sensitivity of the method for detecting small changes in oxygen saturation by monitoring the variations observed during breath-holding and hypoventilation experiments.

  abstract = {Red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis has been reported in units of RBC for transfusion. This has significant clinical implications for transfused patients because the free hemoglobin dissociates into dimers that have to be bound to haptoglobin to be removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Once the binding capacity of haptoglobin has been exceeded, hemoglobinemia occurs. Hemolysis is caused by the breakdown of the RBC, causing release of hemoglobin and resulting in the discoloration of the plasma. Abnormal hemolysis in an individual RBC unit may be caused by several factors including inappropriate handling during processing of blood, inappropriate storage conditions, bacterial hemolysins, antibodies that cause complement lysis, defects in the RBC membrane, or an abnormality in the blood donor. The degree of hemolysis is described as the percent of free hemoglobin in relation to the total hemoglobin with appropriate correction for the hematocrit. The acceptable level of hemolysis has not been established in North America, but the value of 1\% currently is used to assess biocompatibility of blood storage materials, whereas the Council of Europe has set the standard at 0.8\%. This report emphasizes the need for the adequate control of the various processes that are involved in the preparation of RBCs from whole blood to minimize the occurrence of hemolysis. Careful evaluation of manufacturing processes will minimize RBC wastage caused by hemolysis.},

  abstract = {Hemolysis is a fact in all extracorporeal circuits, as shown in various studies by the increasing levels of plasma-free hemoglobin (PfHb) and decreasing levels of haptoglobin during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Beside complete red blood cell (RBC) destruction or hemolysis, RBCs can also be damaged on a sublethal level, resulting in altered rheological properties. Increased levels of free RBC constituents together with an exhaust of their scavengers result in a variety of serious clinical sequela, such as increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, altered coagulation profile, platelet dysfunction, renal tubular damage, and increased mortality. Sublethal RBC damage is characterized by decreased microperfusion and hypoxic RBCs, leading to end organ dysfunction caused by cellular ischemia. Isolated extracorporeal circuit components can be considered non-hemolytic if used according to recommendations, but extracorporeal circuit composition and management during CPB can still be optimized, avoiding cell damaging mechanical forces. Although most RBC destruction in standard CPB remains within the capacity of the endogenous clearing mechanisms, in some cases, levels of PfHb do substantially rise, and precautionary measures need to be taken. Higher degree of hemolysis can be expected in young children, after extensive surgery, and in prolonged support as in patients supported by ventricular assist devices (VADs) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). These patients are especially susceptible to the toxic influences of unscavenged RBC constituents and the loss of rheologic properties of the RBCs. Considering the high percentage of neurologic and renal sequela in post-cardiotomy patients, all imbalances possibly contributing to these morbidities should be focused on and prevented, if not treated. Considering the severity of the consequences of RBC damage, the high incidence of this complication, and especially the lack of interventional strategies in cases of suspected or confirmed RBC damage, there may be a need for a treatment algorithm for this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We describe some misconceptions that have become common practice in reporting blood gas and cooximetry results. In 1980, oxygen saturation was incorrectly redefined in a report of a new instrument for analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) derivatives. Oxygen saturation (sO2) was redefined as the ratio of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) to total Hb instead of the ratio of O2Hb to active Hb (O2Hb + desoxyhemoglobin). In addition, the new terms "functional saturation" and "fractional saturation" were introduced. Since the new parameter was implemented in a widely used cooximeter, its use is now widespread and has caused misunderstandings.
METHODS: In this report, we review the development of the definitions and measurements of sO2 and related quantities and contend that the misconceptions should be resolved by standardizing instrument read-outs and clinical reports, so that sO2, defined as the ratio of O2Hb to active Hb, should replace FO2Hb and be reported along with the total Hb concentration and the common dyshemoglobin fractions (\%CO-Hb and \% methemoglobin [metHb]).
RESULTS: The redefinition of sO2 as the \%O2Hb or FO2Hb did not address the confusion that might result from interchanging these two often-similar but different terms. The term fractional saturation is an inappropriate terminology and lacks clear physiological meaning. We see frequent cases of confusion: (a) the difference between the sO2 in pulse oximetry and the FO2Hb in cooximetry is called the "pulse oximeter gap;" (b) sO2 results are described as "method dependent;" and (c) reference ranges for these terms are substituted.
CONCLUSIONS: Although either parameter could be used by clinicians who fully understand the relatively simple difference between these parameters, we find clear evidence that there is widespread confusion of these terms, even among experts in the field. Standardization of the reporting format would help, and instrument manufacturers could contribute by standardizing the reporting format for cooximetry results.},
