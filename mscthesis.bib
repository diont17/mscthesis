The magnet has been designed to be portable and create a volume with a relatively homogeneous magnetic field, 15,000 ppm over a region from 4 to 16 mm away from the probe, with maximum sensitivity at a depth of 10 mm. The proton NMR frequency is 3.3 MHz. We have demonstrated that with this approach a highly sensitive, portable, unilateral NMR sensor can be built. Such a design is especially suited for the characterisation of liquids in situations where unilateral or portable access is required.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic relaxation rates are measured for whole blood, blood plasma, whole blood clots, and plasma clots in vitro. Relaxation rates are linear in the hematocrit and transverse relaxation rates are significantly greater than longitudinal relaxation rates. Longitudinal relaxation rates measured from 0.01 to 42 MHz for proton Larmor frequencies are found to decline monotonically with increasing magnetic field strength; however, the dispersion curves do not follow a simple Lorentzian behavior, which is anticipated in a suspension of particles in a solution of proteins having a distribution of molecular weights. The transverse relaxation rate is a function of the acquisition parameters, in particular, the choice of TE in either Hahn echo experiments or in echo-train experiments. The origin of this dependence of T2 on TE or the interpulse spacing in an echo train is identified with the exchange of water from inside the red blood cell to the outside and is only an important relaxation mechanism in the case where the blood cell membrane is intact and the cell contains deoxygenated hemoglobin. The dependence of the apparent transverse relaxation rate on the interpulse spacing in a Meiboom-Gill-Carr-Purcell pulse sequence provides the estimate that the mean residence time of water inside the blood cell is about 10 ms. These data provide a sound basis for understanding the dependence of magnetic images on magnetic field strength and the choices of the image acquisition parameters, TE and TR.},

In both deoxygenated blood and gray matter, 1/T2 increased with interecho time, but appeared to level off at times around 50 msec, as expected from the theory of diffusion through magnetic gradients. Diffusion times estimated by using the chemical exchange approximation were 3.4 msec for deoxygenated blood and 5.7 msec for the globus pallidus. The quadratic field dependence in blood is consistent with this same theory, but the linear dependence in brain tissue and in ferritin solutions remains unexplained.},

Deoxygenation increases the volume magnetic susceptibility within the erythrocytes and thus creates local field gradients around these cells. From volume susceptibility measurements and the dependence of T-1(2) on the pulse rate in the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiment, we show that the increase in T-1(2) with increasing blood deoxygenation arises from diffusion of water through these field gradients.},

  abstract = {A precise understanding of human blood spin\textendash{}spin relaxation is of major importance for numerous applications, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is increasingly performed at 3 Tesla. It is well known that T2 measured from partially deoxygenated blood depends on the Carr\textendash{}Purcell Meiboom\textendash{}Gill (CPMG) refocusing interval ($\tau$180) and on blood oxygenation (Y), yet debate remains over the quantification of this phenomenon, primarily with respect to the accuracy of its characterization by the diffusion and fast two-site exchange models. In this study, a detailed characterization of the deoxygenation-induced T2 reduction in human whole blood, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the role of $\tau$180, were performed at 3 T. The diffusion model was found to better fit the observed T2 behavior as compared with the exchange model. The estimated diffusion-model parameters suggest the T2 decay enhancement at 3 T is due to a linear increase in the magnitude of deoxygenation-induced field inhomogeneities with field strength. These findings also confirm the potential of $\tau$180 manipulation in measuring changes in venous blood volume. Magn Reson Med 61:249\textendash{}254, 2009. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The dependence of blood 1H2O T1 on hematocrit fraction (Hct) and oxygen saturation fraction (Y) was determined at 7 T using in vitro bovine blood in a circulating system under physiological conditions. Blood 1H2O R1 values for different conditions could be readily fitted using a two-compartment (erythrocyte and plasma) model, which are described by a monoexponential longitudinal relaxation rate constant dependence. It was found that T1 = 2171 $\pm$ 39 ms for Y = 1 (arterial blood) and 2010 $\pm$ 41 ms for Y = 0.6 (venous blood), for a typical Hct of 0.42. The blood 1H2O T1 values in the normal physiological range (Hct from 0.35 to 0.45, and Y from 0.6 to 1.0) were determined to range from 1900 to 2300 ms. The influence of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and the effect of plasma osmolality for different anticoagulants were also investigated.

Natural aggregation of red cells into rouleaux appeared to cause most of the variation among results from NMR experiments. The remainder of the discrepancy was attributed to the use of inappropriate mathematical approximations of the two-site exchange equations, differences in blood storage time, and failure to adjust NMR calculations for the nonwater protons. Differences in hematocrit, frequency-magnetic field strength, or NMR pulse technique played no apparent role in the disparity among NMR reports. When these confounding factors were removed, diffusion results obtained by NMR or by influx or bulk diffusion of radioactive tracer agreed within a relatively narrow range of values. These techniques place the mean lifetime of water inside fresh normal human erythrocytes at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) between the extremes of 9.8 and 14 ms, where the uncorrected range was previously 9.8-21.7 ms. This new range of water exchange times corresponds to a range of diffusional permeability between 3.3 and 4.7 x 10(-3) cm/s.},

The fluorine resonance was seen as a single peak in both samples, and all three resonances exhibited the same deoxy-oxy shift. Because F- exchanges slowly across the red cell membrane, and because sodium is 95\% extracellular, these results suggest that the intra-extracellular field difference $\Delta$B is less than 0.1 ppm. A small value of $\Delta$B tends to rule out transmembrane exchange as an important contributor to relaxation in MRI of blood and hematomas. However, the broadening of the resonances with deoxygenation, by 0.3-0.4 ppm, indicates that both intra- and extracellular gradients are of comparable and sufficient magnitude to produce the T2-weighted hypointensity seen in clinical magnetic resonance images of hematomas at high fields. \textcopyright{} 1989 Academic Press, Inc.},

It is shown that the relaxation rate is determined by a temporal correlation function and depends quadratically on the magnitude of the inhomogeneities. For the case of unrestricted diffusion, a simple algebraic approximation for the temporal correlation function is derived. The theory is illustrated by applying it to a model of randomly distributed magnetized spheres.

  abstract = {The quantitative evaluation of brain hemodynamics and metabolism, particularly the relationship between brain function and oxygen utilization, is important for the understanding of normal human brain operation, as well as the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. It can also be of great importance for the evaluation of hypoxia within tumors of the brain and other organs. A fundamental discovery by Ogawa and coworkers of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast opened up the possibility to use this effect to study brain hemodynamic and metabolic properties by means of MRI measurements. Such measurements require the development of theoretical models connecting the MRI signal to brain structure and function, and the design of experimental techniques allowing MR measurements to be made of the salient features of theoretical models. In this review, we discuss several such theoretical models and experimental methods for the quantification of brain hemodynamic and metabolic properties. The review's main focus is on methods for the evaluation of the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) based on the measurement of the blood oxygenation level. A combination of the measurement of OEF and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows an evaluation to be made of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). We first consider in detail the magnetic properties of blood \textendash{} magnetic susceptibility, MR relaxation and theoretical models of the intravascular contribution to the MR signal under different experimental conditions. We then describe a `through-space' effect \textendash{} the influence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields, created in the extravascular space by intravascular deoxygenated blood, on the formation of the MR signal. Further, we describe several experimental techniques taking advantage of these theoretical models. Some of these techniques \textendash{} MR susceptometry and T2-based quantification of OEF \textendash{} utilize the intravascular MR signal. Another technique \textendash{} quantitative BOLD \textendash{} evaluates OEF by making use of through-space effects. In this review, we target both scientists just entering the MR field and more experienced MR researchers interested in the application of advanced BOLD-based techniques to the study of the brain in health and disease.

  abstract = {It is shown that a chemical exchange model can reproduce nuclear magnetic relaxation caused by diffusion of water molecules near strongly magnetized particles. The agreement is based on the similarity (but not equivalence) of the respective ``visit-limiting'' mechanisms in the echo-limited regime. The model leads to a single equation that predicts relaxation behavior in both the motional-averaging and visit-limited regimes. When combined with the static-dephasing regime equation, the result is a simple theory (for spheres) that covers the entire range of diffusion times. Magn Reson Med 47:388\textendash{}391, 2002.

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the magnetic properties of human blood is required for the precise modeling of functional and vascular flow-related MRI. Herein are reported determinations of the relaxation parameters of blood, employing in vitro samples that are well representative of human blood in situ. The envelope of the blood 1H2O free-induction decay signal magnitude during the first 100 msec following a spin echo at time TE is well- described empirically by an expression of the form, S(t) = So $\cdot$ exp\{\textendash{}R\,*2 $\cdot$ (t \textendash{} TE) \textendash{} AR* $\cdot$ (t \textendash{} TE)2\}. The relaxation parameters AR* and R\,*2 increase as a function of the square of the susceptibility difference between red blood cell and plasma and depend on the spin-echo time. The Gaussian component, AR*, should be recognized in accurate modeling of MRI phenomena that depend upon the magnetic state of blood. The magnetic susceptibility difference between fully deoxygenated and fully oxygenated red blood cells at 37$^\circ$C is 0.27 ppm, as determined independently by MR and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. This value agrees well with the 1936 report of Pauling and Coryell (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1936;22:210\textendash{}216), but is substantially larger than that frequently used in MRI literature.

  abstract = {The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is investigated for noninvasively estimating the oxygen saturation of human blood (\%HbO2) in vivo by means of relaxation characteristics identified in earlier MR spectrometry studies. To this end, a sequence is presented for determining the T2 of vascular blood in regions in which motions of the body and of the blood itself present a major challenge. With use of this sequence on a commercial 1.5-T whole-body imager, the relationship between the T2 and \%HbO2 of blood is calibrated in vitro for the conditions expected in vivo. T2 varies predictably from about 30 to 250 msec as \%HbO2 varies from 30\% to 96\%. T2 values measured in situ for vascular blood in the mediastinum of several healthy subjects qualitatively reflected the behavior observed in vitro. Estimates of \%HbO2 for these vessels obtained with the in vitro calibration appear reasonable, particularly for venous blood, although difficulties arise in selecting the appropriate calibration factors. These encouraging initial results support a more systematic study of potential sources of error and an examination of the accuracy of in vivo measurements by comparison with direct measurements of \%HbO2 in vessels.},

  abstract = {The 300 MHz (7 T) water proton resonances of suspensions of red blood cells containing paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin can be resolved into two broad lines assignable to intra- and extracellular water which undergoes rapid T2 relaxation by diffusion in magnetic field gradients induced by the intracellular paramagnets. The width of the resolved lines allowed an estimate of the maximum contribution that diffusion makes to T2 relaxation at 7 T. The dependence of the diffusion contribution on the square of the strength of the static magnetic field suggests that diffusion makes a small contribution to water proton T2 relaxation at 1.5 T compared to 7 T, and a negligible one at 0.5 T in early and intermediate hematomas containing deoxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin in intact red blood cells. At the lower field strengths, water proton T2 relaxation is apparently dominated by the rapid chemical exchange (mean lifetime $\tau$ = 10 msec) between the intra- and extracellular environments.},
