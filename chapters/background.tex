\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

\section{NMR theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item Protons in a magnetic field precess at the Larmor frequency
\item T1 and \Ttwo relaxation
\item Bloch equation
\item Spin echo / CPMG refocusing
\item PGSE measurement of displacement by phase shift
\item NMR measurements in flow
\end{itemize}

\section{Blood and oxygen saturation measurement}
\begin{itemize}
\item oxygen transported in red blood cells
\item haemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin
\item pulse oximetry
\item oxygen microelectrode
\item \Ttwo changes due to oxygenation in blood.. LM model, then present JC as alternative theory in \autoref{ch:models}?

\end{itemize}
