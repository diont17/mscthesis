\chapter{Devlopment of a method for continuous \SOtwo measurement}
\label{ch:contsetup}

This chapter is about the system developed to continuously measure the \Ttwo of blood flowing in the circuit as the \SOtwo changes
\section{Experimental setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item Flow Circuit changes
\item different magnet
\item sO2 measurement - optical sensor, calibration
\item Flow stability
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}

Graphs of \Ttwo change at 5 MHz, 10MHz, 14MHz, 20MHz, 40MHz

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item comparisons between different field strengths - agreement with literature
\item mitigation of haemolysis
\item effect of blood velocity on \Ttwo

\end{itemize}
