\chapter{Stopped flow \SOtwo measurements}\label{ch:stoppedflow}

Experimental Setup

\section{Experimental Setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item Flow Circuit
\item Oxygenator, gas mixer
\item introduce iStat sO2 measurement
\item Coil and electronics
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
Short section of results presented at ICMRM - 3 sO2 at 3 diffrent fields
\section{Discussions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hard to set sO2 with gas mixer
\item Effect of blood settling when flow stopped
\item time taken to measure sO2 with iStat
\end{itemize}
