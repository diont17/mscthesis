\chapter{Continuous measurements of \Ttwo and \SOtwo}
\label{ch:cont}

This chapter is about all the results from the continuous loop setup
\section{Experimental Method}
\section{Results}

Graphs of \Ttwo change at 5 MHz, 10MHz, 14MHz, 20MHz, 40MHz

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item comparisons between different field strengths - agreement with literature
\item calibration of \Kzero to \SOtwo
\item mitigation of haemolysis
\item effect of blood velocity on \Ttwo

\end{itemize}
